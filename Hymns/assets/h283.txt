我知誰掌管前途
詩集：生命聖詩，283

1
我知誰掌管前途，我知祂握著我手；
在神萬事非偶然，都是祂計劃萬有。
故我面臨的遭遇，不論大小的難處，
我信靠行奇事的神，一切交託主。

[ I Know Who Holds the Future ]

1
I know who holds the future , And I know he holds my hand;
With God things don't just happen ev'rything by Him is planned.
So as I face tomorrow with its problems large and small,
I'll trust the God of miracles, Give to Him my all!
