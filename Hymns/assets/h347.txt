背十架跟隨主
詩集：生命聖詩，347

1
主阿，我已背起十架，撇下一切跟隨你；
願受貧苦，藐視，厭棄，我的一切盡在你。
我已捨棄諸般欲望，前所獲得與追求，
今我境況何等富足，主與天國我擁有。

2
任憑世界輕我離我，恩主也曾被厭棄，
人面人心虛假奸惡，惟主信實永不欺。
願全智全能的天父，向我施愛顯笑容，
仇敵恨我，朋友離我，主顏一現變光明。

3
我雖遭受困擾苦痛，無非驅我到主前。
世間苦難壓逼越重，天上平安越甘甜。
因有主的慈愛恩典，世間苦痛何足傷，
任何喜樂若主無分，不能令我心歡暢。

4
快從恩典進到光榮，信作武器禱為翼。
永遠福樂在你面前，主必親手領導你。
地上使命將要停止，客旅路程快告終，
信心盼望，樂見實現，祈禱變為讚美聲。

[ Jesus, I My Cross Have Taken ]

1
Jesus, I my cross have taken, All to leave, and follow Thee;
Destitute, despised, forsaken, Thou from hence my all shalt be.
Perish ev-'ry fond ambition, All I've sought, and hoped, or known;
Yet, how rich is my condition! God and heav'n are still my own.

2
Let the world despise and leave me, They have left my Savior, too;
Human hearts and looks deceive me-Thou art not, like man, untrue;
And while Thou shalt smile upon me, God of wisdom, love, and might,
Foes may hate, and friends may shun me; Show Thy face and all is bright.

3
Man may trouble and distress me- 'Twill but drive me to Thy breast.
Life with trials hard may press me; Heav'n will bring me sweeter rest.
O 'tis not in grief to harm me, While Thy love is left to me;
O 'twere not in joy to charm me, Were that joy unmixed with Thee.

4
Hasten on from grace to glory, Armed by faith, and winged by prayer;
Heav'n's eternal day's before thee, God's own hand shall guide thee there.
Soon shall close thy earthly mission, Swift shall pass thy pilgrim days,
Hope shall change to glad fruition, Faith to sight, and prayer to praise.
