與主面對面
詩集：生命聖詩，486

1
面對面見基督救主，面對面將要如何？
親見為我受死耶穌，面對面何等快樂。

2
現在見主還不顯明，彷彿黑影隔當中；
不久那福樂日來臨，親見主榮耀聖容。

3
主同在時何等快樂，憂傷痛苦全消除；
彎曲道路全都修直，隱祕事都要顯露。

4
面對面歡欣的良辰，面對面萬事知清；
面對面見我救贖主，祂的愛何等豐盛。

副歌：
面對面我與主相見，在那遙遠的青天，
面對面在主榮耀中，將來必見主榮面。

[ Face to Face ]

1
Face to face with Christ, my Savior,
Face to face - what will it be,
When with rapture I behold Him,
Jesus Christ Who died for me?

2
Only faintly now I see Him,
With the darkened veil between,
But a blessed day is coming,
When His glory shall be seen.

3
What rejoicing in His presence,
When are banished grief and pain;
When the crooked ways are straightened,
And the dark things shall be plain.

4
Face to face - oh, blissful moment!
Face to face - to see and know;
Face to face with my Redeemer,
Jesus Christ Who loves me

Refrain:

Face to face I shall behold Him,
Far beyond the starry sky;
Face to face in all His glory,
I shall see Him by and by!so.
