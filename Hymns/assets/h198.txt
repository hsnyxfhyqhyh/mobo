來就上主羔羊
詩集：生命聖詩，198

1
像我這樣，無善可陳，主竟為我流血捨身，
得蒙選召，與你親近，真神羔羊，我來，我來。

2
像我這樣，罪惡貫盈，不再妄想自我潔淨，
惟你寶血，使我成聖，真神羔羊，我來，我來。

3
像我這樣，憂愁不安，許多矛盾衝擊疑難，
我心內外恐懼爭戰，真神羔羊，我來，我來。

4
像我這樣，貧困盲目，求你醫治心靈疾苦，
凡我所需你能滿足，真神羔羊，我來，我來。

5
像我這樣，你仍恩待，潔淨釋放赦我罪債，
因我真心信你應許，真神羔羊，我來，我來。

[ Just As I Am ]

1
Just as I am, without one plea,
But that Thy blood was shed for me,
And that Thou bidst me come to Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

2
Just as I am, and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot,
To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

3
Just as I am, though tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt,
Fightings and fears within, without,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

4
Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea, all I need in Thee to find,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

5
Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
Because Thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

6
Just as I am, Thy love unknown
Hath broken every barrier down;
Now, to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
