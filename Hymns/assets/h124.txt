為我受傷
詩集：生命聖詩，124

1
為我受傷，為我受傷，十字架上耶穌為我受傷；
罪蒙赦免我今得著釋放，皆因救主耶穌為我受傷。

2
為我受死，為我受死，十字架上耶穌為我受死；
因祂受死我得救贖福祉，皆因救主耶穌為我受死。

3
為我復活，為我復活，從墳墓裡主已為我復活；
死亡毒鉤今後不能害我，皆因救主耶穌為我復活。

4
為我再來，為我再來，必有一天主要為我再來；
見主慈顏何等喜樂暢快，滿心讚美主，祂為我再來。

[ Wounded for me ]

1
Wounded for me, wounded for me,
There on the cross He was wounded for me;
Gone my transgressions, and now I am free,
All because Jesus was wounded for me.

2
Dying for me, dying for me,
There on the cross He was dying for me;
Now in His death my redemption I see,
All because Jesus was dying for me.

3
Risen for me, risen for me,
Up from the grave He has risen for me;
Now evermore from death's sting I am free,
All because Jesus has risen for me.

4
Coming for me, coming for me,
One day to earth He is coming for me;
Then with what joy His dear face I shall see,
O how I praise Him! He's coming for me!
