>>Invalid Message Channel
A Invalid Message Channel is like an error log for messaging.

How can a messaging receiver gracefully handle receiving a message that makes no sense?

When the receiver discovers that the message it's trying to process is not valid, what should it do with the message?
 
The receiver (in WSO2, the subscriber service is the receiver) should move the improper message to an Invalid Message Channel (a database maybe), a special channel for messages that could not be processed by their receivers.

>>"Dead Letter" Pattern
It handles undeliverable messages. 

Qpid has maximum delivery count and dead-letter queue (DLQ) features which can be used in concert to construct a system that automatically handles such a condition. 
These features are described in the following sections.
	*************
	* Maximum delivery count 
	************* 
	
	Maximum delivery count is a property of a queue.
	
	If a consumer application is unable to process a message more than the specified number of times, then the broker will either route the message to a dead-letter queue (if one has been defined), or will discard the message.

	If the consuming application is using AMQP 0-9-1, 0-9, or 0-8 protocols, it is necessary to set the client system property qpid.reject.behaviour or connection or binding URL option rejectbehaviour to the value system.

	*************
	* Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)
	*************
	When a DLQ is enabled for a given queue if a consuming client indicates it no longer wishes the receive the message (typically by exceeding a Maximum Delivery Count) then the message is moved onto the DLQ and removed from the original queue.
