我的燈需要油
詩集：生命聖詩，351

1
我的燈需要油，求主常賜下；使我燈永遠發亮光；
我的燈需要油，求主常賜下，使我燈發光到主作王。
唱和撒那，唱和撒那，唱和撒那，賀萬王之王！
唱和撒那，唱和撒那，唱和撒那賀我王！

[ Give me oil in the Lamp ]

1
Give me oil in the lamp to keeping me burning.
Give me oil in my lamp, I pray.
Give me oil in my lamp to keep me burning.
Keeping burning till the break of day.
Sing Hosanna, Sing Hosanna,
Sing Hosanna to the King of kings!
Sing Hosanna, Sing Hosanna,
Sing Hosanna to the King!
