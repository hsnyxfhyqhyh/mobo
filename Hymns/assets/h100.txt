馬槽聖嬰
詩集：生命聖詩，100

1
遠遠在馬槽裡，無枕也無床，小小的主耶穌，睡覺很安詳；
眾星都照耀著主安睡地方，小小的主耶穌，睡在乾草上。

2
眾牲畜嗚嗚叫，聖嬰忽驚醒，小小的主耶穌，卻無啼哭聲。
主耶穌，我愛你，求靠近我旁，坐在我小床邊，看守到天亮。

3
求主來臨近我，與我在一起，愛護我，親近我，永遠不分離。
求主賜福孩童，常關懷看顧，讓我們在天家與耶穌同住。

[ Away In A Manger ]

1
Away in a manger, no crib for his bed,
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head;
The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay,
The little Lord Jesus asleep in the hay.

2
The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes;
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
I love you, Lord Jesus; look down from the sky,
And stay by my side until morning is nigh.

3
Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask you to stay
Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.
Bless all the dear children in your tender care,
And fit us for heaven to live with you there.
