>>What is stack overflow
Stack Overflow is a privately held website, the flagship site of the Stack Exchange Network,[2][3] created in 2008 by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky,[4][5] as a more open alternative to earlier Q and A sites such as Experts Exchange. The name for the website was chosen by voting in April 2008 by readers of Coding Horror, Atwood's popular programming blog.
