>>Give a few reasons for using Java?
Java is a fun language. Let’s look at some of the reasons: 
Built-in support for multi-threading, socket communication, and memory management (automatic garbage collection). 
Object Oriented (OO). 
Better portability than other languages across operating systems. 
Supports Web based applications (Applet, Servlet, and JSP), distributed applications (sockets, RMI, EJB etc) and network protocols (HTTP, JRMP etc) with the help of extensive standardized APIs (Application 
Programming Interfaces).

>>What is the main difference between the Java platform and the other software platforms?
Java platform is a software-only platform, which runs on top of other hardware-based platforms like UNIX, NT etc
The Java platform has 2 components: 
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) – ‘JVM’ is a software that can be ported onto various hardware platforms. Byte codes are the machine language of the JVM. 
Java Application Programming Interface (Java API) – set of classes written using the Java language and run on the JVM.
