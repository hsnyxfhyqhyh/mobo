教會獨一的根基
詩集：生命聖詩，215

1
教會獨一的根基，是主耶穌基督，
她是主的新創作，從水與道而出，
主從天上來尋她，作主聖潔新婦，
甘願流自己寶血，捨身將她買贖。

2
教會雖召自萬邦，信徒卻成一體，
同有救恩的憑證，一主一信一洗，
同尊獨一的聖名，同享唯一天糧，
同懷專一的盼望，同蒙恩愛無量。

3
教會歷盡了苦難，世人譏笑毀謗，
內爭分裂她身體，異端叛道中傷，
聖徒儆醒爭相問，黑夜到底多長？
哭泣將變為歌唱，轉眼即見晨光。

4
教會在地卻聯合，真神三位一體，
已享安息的聖徒，奧祕甜蜜團契；
懇求主賜恩我們，能像快樂聖徒，
同樣溫柔且謙虛，與主天上居住。

[ The Church's One Foundation ]

1
The Church's one foundation is Jesus Christ her Lord;
She is His new creation by water and the Word:
From Heav'n He came and sought her to be His holy bride;
With His own blood He bought her, and for her life He died.

2
Elect from every nation, yet one o'er all the earth,
Her charter of salvation, one Lord, one faith, one birth;
One holy name she blesses, par-takes one holy food;
And to one hope she presses, With every grace endued.

3
Though with a scornful wonder Men see her sore oppressed,
By schisms rent asunder, By heresies distressed,
Yet saints their watch are keeping, their cry goes up- "How long?"
But soon the night of weeping shall be the morn of song.

4
Yet she on earth hath union with God the Three in One,
And mystic sweet communion with those whose rest is won.
O happy ones and holy! Lord, give us grace that we,
Like them, the meek and lowly, on high may dwell with Thee.
